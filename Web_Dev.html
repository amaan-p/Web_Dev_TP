        The <span class="gtrname">GF-BNR34 (R34)</span>Skyline GT-R, GT-R V·Spec
        and GT-R V·Spec N1 models were introduced in January 1999. The R34 GT-R
        was shorter (from front to rear), and the front overhang was reduced as
        compared to its predecessor. The valve covers were painted glossy red
        (colour code Cherry Red Effect Z24 or X1020) as opposed to black in
        previous models.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the time of the R34's introduction, like the R32 and R33, Nissan
        introduced an R34 V·Spec N1[62] model. The R34 V·Spec N1 was equipped
        similar to the R32 and R33 N1 models a homologation special. It was sold
        without air conditioning, audio equipment, rear wiper, or boot lining,
        but ABS remained. The new R34 N1 was also given the new R34 N1 engine.
        Only 38[63] known R34 V·Spec N1 models were produced from the factory,
        12 of which Nismo used for Super Taikyu racing. The rest were sold to
        various customers, mostly racing teams and tuning garages.
